## Project Overview

This is a simple personal portfolio website for Lucy. The site consists of three main files:
- `index.html` - Main page with personal description and contact information
- `script.js` - Interactive functionality (clicking the "Lucy" header cycles through "Goose", "HONK", "Lucy")
- `styles.css` - Minimal, responsive styling with modern typography

## Architecture

The project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no build process or dependencies. The site is designed to be lightweight and minimal:

- **HTML**: Single page with semantic structure
- **CSS**: Modern system fonts, responsive design, minimal styling
- **JavaScript**: Simple DOM manipulation for the header click interaction
